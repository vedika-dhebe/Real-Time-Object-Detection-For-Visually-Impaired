## **Overview**
This project is an object detection application designed to assist visually impaired individuals by identifying objects in real time and converting their names into speech. The system uses YOLOv3 for object detection and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech (TTS) functionality, allowing users to hear the names of detected objects.

## **Features**
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv3.
- Speech output for detected objects via pyttsx3.
- Works with a webcam to identify objects in front of the user.
- Lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time usage.

## **Technologies Used**
- Python
- OpenCV (for video processing)
- YOLO weights and configuration files
- pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech conversion)
- YOLOv3 (for object detection)
